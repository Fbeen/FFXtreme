# FF Xtreme: On Screen Display for FlashFloppy with adapted hardware and firmware for the Atari ST

## Original project page
This project is a extended version of Keir Fraser [**FlashFloppy**](https://github.com/keirf/flashfloppy) and [**FF OSD**](https://github.com/keirf/flashfloppy-osd).
You should take a look at his work first!

## About this project
Keirfs On Screen Display (OSD) doesn´t support a keyboard controller for the Atari ST while this version does.
I have added some extra futures to the firmware as well:
- Send FlashFloppy output to your Atari ST video display in all three resolutions, monochrome included.
- Control FlashFloppy via your Atari keyboard (Optional but prefered)
- Reset your Atari ST from the keyboard (Optional)
- Toggle intern and extern floppy to be disk A/B so that you are able to boot from your extern floppy drive.
- Switch your TOS roms (optional + extra hardware)
- Switch between mono and stereo sound (optional + extra hardware)

FF OSD also emulates the popular LCD I2C interface, allowing
connection to a wider range of hardware which traditionally uses anLCD.
